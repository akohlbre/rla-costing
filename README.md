# rla-costing
Developing a cost model for Risk-Limiting Audits

## Model of Operational Costs
### Running the Model
1. You can download the model and run it locally with Python 3.
Specify a filename with the `-f` flag to have the model use it as the input. If no file
is specified, the model will look for a file named `state.csv` and use it. If that file does not
exist, the model will use default values. See below for the input format

1. You can instead run the model on https://repl.it/languages/python3. It's probably easiest to
copy the contents of `model.py` into the white window on repl.it (rather than uploading a file to
repl.it). You can then change the input numbers at the top and click the "run" button to see the
output, which is the total cost in dollars.

### Input Format
To allow use by the greatest number of users, the input format is a csv file, which can
be written by hand or generated by any standard spreadsheet software. Only the first two
columns are significant. The names of fields go in the first column, and the values in the second.
Example:

|name of field|value|explanation|
| --- | --- | --- |
|number of ballots|500000|The total number of ballots expected. Example: 500000
|margin| 5|The margin, in percentage points. Example: 5
|RLA type|polling|The type of RLA, either "polling" or "comparison". Example: polling
hourly wage	|20	|The hourly rate for employees, in US dollars. Example: 20
pilot	|yes| Whether or not this is a pilot or first-time RLA, either "yes" or "no". Example: yes
number of contests |3| The number of individual contests that will be audited. Example: 3
number of locations |1| The number of separate locations that will conduct part of the audit. Example: 1

Capitalization doesn't matter, and there's no need to have a header row ("name of field".. above)
or a column for explanations, although neither is problematic.
