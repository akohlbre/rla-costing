# rla-costing
Developing a cost model for Risk-Limiting Audits

## Running the Model
1. You can download the model and run it locally with Python 3

1. You can instead run the model on https://repl.it/languages/python3. It's probably easiest to
copy the contents of `model.py` into the white window on repl.it (rather than uploading a file to
repl.it). You can then change the input numbers at the top and click the "run" button to see the
output, which is the total cost in dollars.
